## Student Information
Name: Iqra Naseem  
Roll No: 231400110  

## Project Description
This project implements Unit Testing and Integration Testing for a simple banking application using PyTest.
Individual functions are tested using unit tests, while integration tests verify the interaction between multiple functions.
Continuous Integration (CI) is implemented using GitHub Actions.

## How to Run Tests
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run all tests:
pytest -v
## GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is configured to automatically run all unit and integration tests whenever code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is created.
This ensures early detection of errors and maintains code quality.
